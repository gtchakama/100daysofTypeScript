Type Aliases

TypeScript allows us to declare type aliases by using the type keyword:

type PrimitiveArray = Array<string|number|boolean>;
type MyNumber = number;
type NgScope = ng.IScope;
type Callback = () => void;

Type aliases are exactly the same as their original types; they are simply alternative names.
Type aliases can help us to make our code more readable.
