In TypeScript, we use these primitive values in an interface
to form a blueprint for an Object or Class
like in the example in sandbox.ts File.

Interface
Most of the models in TypeScript are a combination of interfaces
and classes. An interface is a blueprint of a class or object. 
In this IPizza interface, we define all the properties a pizza has.
In each property, we define what kind of data type the information is.
Every property that is defined in an interface is required. 
If you want to make it optional you have to use the ?. 
For example propertyName?: string if we define this property in an interface,
 it's optional. TypeScript won't give you an error if the property is missing in an object.
  On the other hand, if a property is required, it will give an error if the property is missing.
