Tuple Types
A tuple type is another sort of Array type that knows 
exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly 
which types it contains at specific positions.

let StringNumberPair = [String, number];

Here, StringNumberPair is a tuple type of string 
and number . Like ReadonlyArray , it has no
representation at runtime, but is significant to
 TypeScript. To the type system, StringNumberPair
describes arrays whose 0 index contains a string 
and whose 1 index contains a number .


Enums
Enums are a feature added to JavaScript by TypeScript
 which allows for describing a value which could be one 
 of a set of possible named constants. Unlike most TypeScript
features, this is not a type-level addition to JavaScript but
something added to the language and runtime.

In addition to generic interfaces, we can also create 
generic classes. Note that it is not possible to
create generic enums and namespaces
