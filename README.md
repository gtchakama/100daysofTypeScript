# 100 Days of TypeScript

This is a way of me boosting my skills in TypeScript.

## The Rules

1. I will do 100 small TypeScript projects.
2. There's no time limit on how long an individual exercise can take.
3. Perfect is the enemy of good. I will not be afraid of making mistakes.
4. I will ask for help when I need it.

## The Projects

You can view the Projects on my personal portfolio once i reach project number 10.
